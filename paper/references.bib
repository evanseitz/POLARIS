Here we present a new approach capable of mapping the continuous motions of such nanomachines along their trajectories in the free-energy landscape and demonstrate this capability in the context of experimental cryogenic electron microscope snapshots of the ribosome, the nanomachine responsible for protein synthesis in all living organisms. We believe our approach constitutes a universal platform for the analysis of free-energy landscapes and conformational motions of molecular nanomachines and their dependencies on temperature, buffer conditions, and regulatory factors.A Brownian machine, a tiny device buffeted by the random motions of molecules in the environment, is capable of exploiting these thermal motions for many of the conformational changes in its work cycle. Such machines are now thought to be ubiquitous, with the ribosome, a molecular machine responsible for protein synthesis, increasingly regarded as prototypical. Here we present a new analytical approach capable of determining the free-energy landscape and the continuous trajectories of molecular machines from a large number of snapshots obtained by cryogenic electron microscopy. We demonstrate this approach in the context of experimental cryogenic electron microscope images of a large ensemble of nontranslating ribosomes purified from yeast cells. The free-energy landscape is seen to contain a closed path of low energy, along which the ribosome exhibits conformational changes known to be associated with the elongation cycle. Our approach allows model-free quantitative analysis of the degrees of freedom and the energy landscape underlying continuous conformational changes in nanomachines, including those important for biological function.},

	abstract = {The folding energy landscape of proteins has been suggested to be funnel-like with some degree of ruggedness on the slope. How complex the landscape, however, is still rather unclear. Many experiments for globular proteins suggested relative simplicity, whereas molecular simulations of shorter peptides implied more complexity. Here, by using complete conformational sampling of 2 globular proteins, protein G and src SH3 domain and 2 related random peptides, we investigated their energy landscapes, topological properties of folding networks, and folding dynamics. The projected energy surfaces of globular proteins were funneled in the vicinity of the native but also have other quite deep, accessible minima, whereas the randomized peptides have many local basins, including some leading to seriously misfolded forms. Dynamics in the denatured part of the network exhibited basin-hopping itinerancy among many conformations, whereas the protein reached relatively well-defined final stages that led to their native states. We also found that the folding network has the hierarchic nature characterized by the scale-free and the small-world properties.},

The basis of the understanding is the observation that the energy landscape is complex: Proteins can assume a large number of nearly isoenergetic conformations (conformational substates). The concepts that emerge from studies of the conformational substates and the motions between them permit a quantitative discussion of one simple reaction, the binding of small ligands such as carbon monoxide to myoglobin.",
